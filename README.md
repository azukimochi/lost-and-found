# Lost & Found

![](README_images/screenshot-general.png)

### Project Description: 

This is an online platform that attempts to solve the problem with lost and found items: Sometimes, you do not know who to give the lost item to or you are never sure if the middle person will ever try to find the owner.  With this online platform, users can post items that they have lost and items that they have found.  With a MySQL database, the new listings are updated in real-time.  Users can browse tables to see if any of the lost/found items match what they are looking for.  They can claim items, thus triggering an email to be sent to them.  The email of the user that posted the item will be included in the email message. Users are thus encouraged to reach out to one another to exchange the items they have found.  

SMS is also used in this application upon signing up.  However, because we are using a free version of the SMS node package, the SMS is sent to one mobile number only. 

User authentication is included.  Users will need to register for an account and log-in to use the service.  Otherwise, the buttons will be disabled if they are not logged in.
